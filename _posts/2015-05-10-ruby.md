## Test against true/false.

Prefer

```ruby
if not a.nil?
  # do something
end
```

over

```ruby
if a
  # do something
end
```

## Prefer `f()` for non `void` functions, and `f` for actions/side effects.

```ruby
# @param number [Fixnum]
# @return character [String]
def f(n)
  n
end

# @return character [String]
def f_1()
  f(1)
end

# @param number [Fixnum]
# @return [void] prints to screen
def print_number n
  puts n
end

# @return [void] prints to screen
def print_1
  print_number 1
end
```

## Use `{}` for blocks rerunning value, and `do end` for other blocks.

```ruby
l = [1, 2, 3]

l.each do |n| n += 1 end

l.map { |n|
  b = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 3.0
  b.to_s
}

identity = ->(x) { x }
say = ->(x) do puts x end
```

## Avoid `Proc.new` and `proc`.

Almost always avoid `Proc.new`.

Never use `proc`. Its behavior is different for Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9+.

## Use `self` module functions.

Prefer

```ruby
mod M
  def self.a; 'a'; end
  def self.b; 'b'; end
  # more ...
end

M.a()
```

over

```ruby
module M
  # module_function will copy the functions. No need to make duplicated
  # functions unless you want to let other classes include your module
  # and let them pollute other classes' namespcae.
  module_function

  def a; 'a'; end
  def b; 'b'; end
  # more ...
end

M.a()
```

over

```ruby
class C
  # Do not build a class just for some functions. Use module for this.
  class << self

    def a; 'a'; end
    def b; 'b'; end
    # more ...
  end
end

C.a()
```

and

```ruby
class C
  def a; 'a'; end
  def b; 'b'; end
  # more ...
end

# This is redundant.
c = C.new()
c.a()
```

The following rules are borrowed from [scheme-style](http://community.schemewiki.org/?scheme-style).

Since scheme uses a lot of parens and Ruby do not, so we apply this rule:

If in equivalent scheme code, there will be a paren, then indent two spaces.
Otherwise indent one spaces.

For example:

```lisp
(1
 2
 3)
```

```ruby
[1,
 2,
 3]
```

and

```lisp
(Î» (x)
 x)
```

```ruby
->(x) {
 x }



## Parens tend to feel lonely.

Don't put closing  parens on a line of their own. They get lonely easily. Seriously, it's superfluous information and takes up lines for nothing.

In Ruby, the following characters are considered as closing parens:

- `)`
- `]`
- `}`
- `end`

Example:

```ruby
def print_a_line_list()
  [ "a very long item"
    "another item"
    "3"].each do |i|
      puts i end end
```
