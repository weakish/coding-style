## Naming

We prefer `hyphen-word` over `snake_case` over `CamelCase`.
However, `dash` and busybox's `ash` [only allows `_` and alnum as variable and
function names][alnum].
And sh does not has namespaces. Thus we use `CamelCase`, and save `_` for
namespaces.

[alnum]: https://github.com/mirror/busybox/blob/1_23_stable/libbb/endofname.c

To distinguish function name and variable names, we use:

- `VariableName`
- `functionName`

## Short options

BusyBox uses `-s` over `--long` options. So we prefer `-s` over `--long` for
commands included in busybox compatibility.

For other commands, you prefer `--long` for self-documentation.
