## Naming

We prefer `hyphen-word` over `snake_case` over `CamelCase`.
However, `dash` [only allows `_` and alnum as variable and
function names][alnum].
And sh does not have namespaces.
Thus, we use `CamelCase`, and save `_` for namespaces.

## Short options

We prefer `--long` for self-documentation.

## Compatibility

Test against dash.

## Fails early

Use `set -e`.

## Local variable

Use `local` variables in function definitions when possible.
