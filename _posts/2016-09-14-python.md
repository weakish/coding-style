Coding Style for Python
=======================

## Variable naming

* Use a `var_` prefix for `var_reassignable_variable`.

## Modules

* Use '_' prefixed names instead of ``__all__`` list.  This is simple and
  straight up, and doesn't require the additional effort to maintain an
  extra list.

## Tests

Most of the time I just use doctest,
since it's easy to maintain consistency of code, test and documentation.
