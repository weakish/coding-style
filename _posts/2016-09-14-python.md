Coding Style for Python
=======================

## Modules

- Use '_' prefixed names instead of ``__all__`` list.
  This is simple and straight up, and doesn't require the additional effort to maintain an extra list.

## Tests

Most of the time I just use doctest in standard library, since keeping code, test, and documentation in the same place is easier to maintain.
