Coding Style for Python
=======================

Styles stolen from Google

### Main

Even a file meant to be used as a script should be importable and a mere
import should not have the side effect of executing the script's main
functionality. The main functionality should be in a main() function.

In Python, pychecker, pydoc, and unit tests require modules to be importable.
Your code should always check if __name__ == '__main__' before executing
your main program so that the main program is not executed when the module
is imported.


Personal
--------

### Variable naming

* Use a `var_` prefix for `var_reassignable_variable`.

### Modules

* Use '_' prefixed names instead of ``__all__`` list.  This is simple and
  straight up, and doesn't require the additional effort to maintain an
  extra list.

### Tests

Most of the time I just use doctest,
since it's easy to maintain consistency of code, test and documentation.
